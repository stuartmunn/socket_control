# socket_control

This app is a web based contoller for Energie Sockets with a Raspberry Pi control hat (https://energenie4u.co.uk/catalogue/product/ENER002-2PI).

The app is using Python Flask to create a simple web server and run commands.

The web interface can be used interactively or as a web service to allow other computers to control.

Please note that I cannot claim credit for the original code. I found it at https://pythonhosted.org/energenie/examples/web/#web-interface-example. This
code serves as the base for this project.
