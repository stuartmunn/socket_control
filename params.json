{"name":"Socket control","tagline":"Web Enabled Control on Raspberry Pi for Energie Smart Sockets ","body":"This app is a web based controller for Energenie Sockets with a Raspberry Pi control hat (https://energenie4u.co.uk/catalogue/product/ENER002-2PI).\r\n\r\n![MobileExample](http://1drv.ms/1otgaCf)\r\n\r\nIt uses Python Flask to create a simple web server that switches the sockets on and off. Fantastic for controlling lamps in your house or for switching power on and off in hard to reach places.\r\n\r\nThe web interface can be used interactively or as a web service to allow other computers to control.\r\n\r\nPlease note that I based this on code I found at https://pythonhosted.org/energenie/examples/web/#web-interface-example. While the code found there servers as the base for this project, I have modified it to control all four socket groups and to look better on a mobile screen.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
