Fantastic for controlling lamps in your house or for switching power on and off in hard to reach places.\r\n\r\nThe web interface can be used interactively or as a web service to allow other computers to control.\r\n\r\nPlease note that I based this on code I found at https://pythonhosted.org/energenie/examples/web/#web-interface-example. While the code found there servers as the base for this project, I have modified it to control all four socket groups and to look better on a mobile screen.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
